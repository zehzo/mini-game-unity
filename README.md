# Project Name: Unity 2D Basics Practice

---

## Description:
Welcome to our Unity 2D Basics Practice project! This project is designed for educational purposes, aiming to help us, a group of friends, enhance our understanding of fundamental Unity concepts and refine our skills in using GitHub effectively. We'll be working on creating a basic 2D game with essential functionalities to solidify our grasp on Unity's capabilities.

## Goals:
- Gain hands-on experience with Unity's 2D features.
- Practice implementing basic game mechanics, such as player movement, collisions, and scoring systems.
- Familiarize ourselves with version control using Git and GitHub.
- Collaborate efficiently as a team, employing best practices for GitHub workflows.

## Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
   
2. Open the project in Unity by selecting the project folder.

3. Familiarize yourself with the project structure and existing codebase.

## Project Structure:
- **Assets**: Contains all the assets used in the project, including sprites, scripts, and scenes.
- **Scripts**: Houses all the C# scripts for controlling game behavior and mechanics.
- **Scenes**: Contains the different scenes of the game, such as the main menu, gameplay scene, and game over screen.
- **Sprites**: Stores the 2D sprites used for characters, obstacles, and other elements in the game.

## Contributing:
1. Before starting any work, pull the latest changes from the `develop` branch to ensure you're working with the most up-to-date codebase:
   ```
   git pull origin develop
   ```

2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
   ```
   git checkout -b feature/my-feature
   ```

3. Implement your changes, following the coding conventions and style guidelines established in the project.

4. Once your changes are ready, commit them with descriptive messages:
   ```
   git commit -m "Add player movement functionality"
   ```

5. Push your changes to the remote repository:
   ```
   git push origin feature/my-feature
   ```

6. Create a pull request on GitHub, detailing the changes made and any relevant information.

7. Collaborate with team members to review the pull request, address feedback, and ensure the quality of the code.
